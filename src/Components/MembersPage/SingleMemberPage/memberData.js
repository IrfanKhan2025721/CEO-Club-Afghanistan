      "CEO Club Afghanistan was born from a simple but powerful idea: Afghanistan needs strong, ethical, and globally connected leaders. Over the years, I have witnessed immense talent across our country—young entrepreneurs, determined women, visionary CEOs—yet many lack access to mentorship, global exposure, and trusted professional networks. CEO Club Afghanistan exists to bridge that gap. Our mission is to create a platform where Afghan leaders can learn, collaborate, and grow together while staying rooted in integrity, inclusivity, and national responsibility.",
